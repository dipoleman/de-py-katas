# fill_square

The function `fill_square` should accept a nested list as it's only argument and fill those lists so that they are a square matrix with the value None standing in for any blank positions in the matrix.

If extra sub-lists are needed to complete the square, these should be added at the bottom of the matrix.

## Example

```py
square = [[1, 2, 3], [1, 2], [1]]

fill_square(square)
# [
#   [1, 2, 3],
#   [1, 2, None],
#   [1, None, None]
# ]
```
