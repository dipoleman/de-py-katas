# Count Bits

Write a function `count_bits` that accepts an **integer** as an argument and returns the numbers of bits that are equal to 1 in the binary representation of that number.

You can assume that the input will be non-negative.

## Example:

```py
count_bits(1234) # 5
```

> The binary representation of 1234 is 10011010010

> There are five bits that are equal to 1 therefore the function returns 5
